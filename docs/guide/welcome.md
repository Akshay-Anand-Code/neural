# Welcome Screen

The welcome screen is the first interface users encounter when accessing Project X. It features a cyberpunk-inspired design with quantum-themed animations and security elements.

## Features

### Access Control
- Password-protected entry
- Quantum signature verification
- Neural interface status monitoring

### Visual Elements
- Matrix-style rain effect
- Glowing interface elements
- System status indicators

### Status Indicators
- Neural Link
- Quantum Sync
- Security Status
- System Scan

## Usage

1. Enter the access password in the quantum-encrypted input field
2. System will verify your credentials
3. Upon successful verification, you'll be granted access to the dashboard

## Code Example

```typescript
const handleAccess = async (password: string) => {
  if (password === accessCode) {
    setAuthorized(true);
    navigate('/dashboard');
  } else {
    setError('QUANTUM SIGNATURE MISMATCH');
  }
};
```

## Security Notes

- Access attempts are logged and monitored
- Failed attempts trigger quantum state analysis
- Neural patterns are recorded for verification
