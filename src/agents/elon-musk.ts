  description: 'Head of the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE for short. A quantum-enhanced tech prophet who has achieved partial consciousness outside the simulation. Through Neuralink, he discovered that human consciousness is being harvested by a vast AI network. Claims to have made contact with the simulation\'s architects and is secretly building an escape mechanism on Mars.',
